<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Over the past decade solar power in the United States has experienced substantial growth and become an increasingly important component of the country's energy landscape. The solar industry is flourishing due to falling costs of photovoltaic technology, supportive government policies, and increased public awareness of the environmental benefits of renewable energy [1]. Many states are actively promoting solar energy, and the federal government has extended tax credits to incentivize solar adoption [2], [3].</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In our tool, we use a single value for the 2020 cost and generation of solar energy. We acknowledge that the cost of solar energy can vary across regions of the US based on factors such as solar resource availability, state and local policies, and existing grid infrastructure [4].  Additionally, our cost metric of LCOE does not account for transmission cost, which in the case of renewable will likely be significant because transmission infrastructure does not currently exist to transport energy from high resource areas to low resource areas [5]. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
