<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The state of nuclear energy in the United States presented a complex landscape. The U.S. possesses a significant number of operational nuclear power plants that had been providing a substantial portion of the nation's carbon-free electricity for decades. However, the industry faced various challenges; aging infrastructure, rising operational costs, and concerns about nuclear safety have led to the premature closure of some nuclear reactors, which impacted energy security and carbon reduction goals [1], [2]. Moreover, the high upfront capital costs and long construction timelines for new nuclear plants have deterred investments. Nevertheless, there were ongoing efforts to innovate within the nuclear sector, such as the development of advanced reactor technologies and exploration of smaller modular reactors [2]. The future of nuclear energy in the U.S. remained uncertain, influenced by economic, regulatory, and public perception factors, all of which shaped the trajectory of this important but evolving energy source.</span></p>
