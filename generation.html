<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">This diagram shows the current zero (and very low) carbon generation in the U.S. on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis shows the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of each of the technologies if they were being build new today. Of course, these generators have already been built (they are sunk cost). &nbsp;However, as you add more generation, or replace older generation that retires, that will require new expenditures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The [color] vertical dotted line in this diagram shows the target that you will need to meet in 2050, based on the choices you made previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">As you can see there is a gap between the current amount of zero and very low emission generation that the U.S. has today, in the amount that will be needed by 2050 to meet your target.</span></p>
