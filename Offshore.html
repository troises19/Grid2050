<p class="p1"><span class="s1">OFFSHORE WIND</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Offshore wind energy in the United States is an emerging and promising sector of renewable energy with significant potential for growth. The industry has witnessed remarkable progress in both planning and implementation [1]. Multiple offshore wind projects have advanced to construction and operational stages along the East Coast, particularly in states like Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Virginia [1]. These projects, when completed, are expected to contribute substantial clean electricity to the nation's grid. Federal and state governments continue to support offshore wind development, with streamlined permitting processes and incentives aimed at catalyzing investment. Technological advancements in larger and more efficient turbines have improved the cost-effectiveness and energy output of offshore wind farms. While challenges such as grid integration and environmental considerations persist, they are being addressed through collaborative efforts and innovative solutions. Offshore wind energy could become an integral part of the U.S. renewable energy landscape, offering a sustainable path forward for reducing carbon emissions and advancing energy security.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">There are two categories of offshore wind: floating and fixed bottom. Fixed bottom platforms are attached to the seabed, while floating platforms are anchored using cables. Since there are not currently any floating wind projects in any stage of development in the US, the cost values used in this tool reflect the cost of fixed bottom wind. As the technology develops, we will continue to update these assumptions [2]. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
