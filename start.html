<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>In 2020 US total electricity generation was just over 4,000 TWhrs. Roughly 60% of that generation came from burning fossil fuels. Just under 20% came from nuclear plants, many of which are now getting quite old. Most of the remaining came from hydropower (roughly 6%) wind (roughly 10%) and solar (roughly 3.5%).&nbsp;<span style="font-size:13px;">(Data from EIA)</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>This tool is designed to help you explore the issues that will be involved in decarbonize some, or all, of this electricity generation between 2025 and 2050.&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="color:#333333;">Most experts now agree that it will not be possible to achieve a deep reduction in the emissions of carbon dioxide from the electricity system by 2050 using just a single technology. Instead, a portfolio (i.e., a mix) of several different technologies will be required. Just how much generation each of these technologies will be able to achieve, and what each will cost, is uncertain.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="color:#333333;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="color:#333333;">In the list on the left are the set of generation technologies that you can use as you build your portfolio. &nbsp;Our apologies if one or more of your favorite technologies are not included. Future versions of the tool will support a longer list.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="color:#333333;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="color:#333333;">Click on the box next to each technology that you would like to be able to use as you build your portfolio. If you would like to read more about the underlying assumptions associated with each technology, click on the Assumptions tab on the menu.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>To get started you need to choose two numbers:&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The annual rate at which future demand for electricity will grow. &nbsp; Recently electricity generation has been growing at about 2.5%/year. &nbsp;However, things like transportation, heating, and industry may switch to electricity to reduce the use of fossil fuels. &nbsp;Clearly if that happens, the growth rate between 2025 and 2050 could be higher.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The fraction of total electricity generation that you want to see decarbonized by 2050.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>You can choose those number by adjusting two sliders. The first slider determines the annual growth in electricity demand that you expect will occur in the US between 2025 and 2050. The second slider sets the decarbonization goal in terms of the percentage of generation that should come from zero (or very low) emission technology in 2050. The tool will combine these two numbers to display a 2050 &ldquo;no carbon generation goal&rdquo; which will be displayed as a red dashed line in each of the graphs you will see as you go forward using the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>If later you want to come back and specify different values for these two numbers, you will be able to do that.</p>
