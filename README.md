Grid2050 is a web-based tool that serves as a decision support framework that allows users to build and assess low-carbon electricity generation technology portfolios for the US. Although we integrated base assumptions from various sources to support a default portfolio mix, the framework encourages users to alter assumptions about the techno-economic performance and socio-political acceptance of different technologies to create their own portfolios. To support that process, the framework includes built-in analytics to estimate deviations from base assumptions, assumptions regarding technological learning and scale-up, and the premiums that users are willing to incur to avoid or deploy different technologies. This suite of features offers a way of benchmarking the consistency and feasibility of usersâ€™ energy system preferences. Its use should help inform energy system planning studies and regulatory interventions to bend the global warming curve.  The functionality of Grid2050 includes four main steps: goal setting, generation portfolios, uncertainty, and time dynamics. Consult the User Manual for additional information.
