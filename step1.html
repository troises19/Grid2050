<h1>Build a 2050 Electricity Portfolio</h1>
Please click on the instructions below to read more about this step in the tool and how to complete your 2050 electricity portfolio.

  <summary>Instructions</summary>
  <p>This diagram shows the current zero (and very low) carbon generation in the U.S. on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis shows the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of each of the technologies if they were being build new today. Of course, these generators have already been built (they are sunk cost).  However, as you add more generation, or replace older generation that retires, that will require new expenditures. These cost values are estimates for 2025, we know that as technology advances and more is built the prices will drop. You will be able to explore these changes in price later in the tool. There is a slider for LCOE, if you disagree with our assumptions for the 2025 cost of technology you can change it. More in-depth information about each technology can be found in the assumptions menu. </p>

<p>The vertical dotted red line in this diagram shows the target that needs to be meet in 2050, to get to the level of decarbonization your previous choices imply.</p>

<p>As you can see there is a gap between the current amount of zero and very low emission generation that the U.S. has today, in the amount that will be needed by 2050 to meet your target.</p>

<p>Next select each technology you are going to add and use the sliders to choose how much of each you want to deploy between 2025 and 2050. Remember that between 2025 and 2050 is only 25 years and there are limits to how rapidly any specific new technology can be implemented. When you choose to implement a particular technology two numbers will appear: the adoption rate (in %/year) that your choice implies and the highest adoption rate that has been achieved by this technology in recent years. The tool works with single year time steps so, for example an adoption rate of 5% means that the amount of a given technology increases 5% every year. If you make a choice that is substantially higher than the highest recent adoption rate, the system will ask you to suggest why you think achieving that higher route is going to be possible.
