<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CCS</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the United States represents an evolving approach to addressing carbon emissions from industrial processes and power generation. The country has seen a growing interest in CCS technologies as part of broader efforts to mitigate climate change. Several CCS projects are in various stages of development, including enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications, which capture carbon dioxide emissions and utilize them to extract more oil from mature oilfields [1]. The federal government has also taken steps to support CCS initiatives through tax incentives and research funding. Challenges, however, remain, including the high costs associated with CCS deployment and the need for infrastructure development to transport and store captured carbon dioxide safely. As the U.S. intensifies its focus on reducing carbon emissions, CCS is likely to play an increasingly prominent role in the country's efforts to combat climate change while maintaining essential industrial processes and energy production.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Several of the underlying calculation in the tool rely on an initial generation for a given technology. As a result, we use the generation capacity of Petra Nova, the first operational CCS plant in the US, as the current capacity for the CCS. Petra Nova was closed in 2020 due to the drop in oil prices resulting from COVID but has reopened as of September 2023 [2]. Also, the LCOE value used in the tool reflects the average of cost CCS on coal and CCS on natural gas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
