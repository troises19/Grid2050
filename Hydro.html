<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HYDROPOWER</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Hydropower is a long standing energy source in the US with many established hydropower facilities that have been providing reliable and renewable electricity for decades. Hydropower has been a vital component of the U.S. energy mix, accounting for a substantial portion of the nation's current renewable energy generation. However, growth in the hydropower sector has been relatively slow due to limited opportunities for new large-scale dam construction and environmental concerns associated with some projects. Nonetheless, there has been a push to modernize and upgrade existing hydropower infrastructure, as well as to explore smaller, more environmentally friendly hydroelectric projects. Additionally, the integration of hydropower with other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, is gaining traction to enhance grid stability.</span></p>
