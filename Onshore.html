<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ONSHORE WIND</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Today, onshore wind energy in the United States is a cornerstone of the nation's renewable energy portfolio. The sector has continued to grow and mature, contributing significantly to the country's clean energy goals [1]. The U.S. has seen the proliferation of onshore wind farms in various regions, from the Great Plains to the Midwest and beyond. Technological advancements, including larger and more efficient wind turbines, have boosted the cost-effectiveness and energy generation capacity of these projects. State-level policies and incentives, coupled with federal support from tax incentives, have fostered a favorable environment for onshore wind development [1].</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In our tool, we use a single value for the 2020 cost and generation of wind energy. We acknowledge that the cost of wind energy can vary across regions of the US based on factors such as wind resource availability, state and local policies, and existing grid infrastructure [1], [2].  Additionally, our cost metric of LCOE does not account for transmission cost, which in the case of renewable will likely be significant because transmission infrastructure does not currently exist to transport energy from high resource areas to low resource areas [3]. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
